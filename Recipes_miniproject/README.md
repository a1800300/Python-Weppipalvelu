# RecipeCollector

## RecipeCollector is a application where you and other users can collect and save favourite recipes.


This is a web programming project done for the Haaga-Helia - course <em>Python weppipalvelu - ideasta tuotantoon (ICT8TN034-3001).</em>

### Additional information:

- The recipes you save are public to other logged users in this    stage.




- In the future the idea is to add a generator where the application randomly selects one of your recipes (still in progress)

- The application works, but is still in progress (beta)
